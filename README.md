# BlankTimer


- The watch OS app contains two screens.
- User can set a timer on first screen based on hours, minutes and seconds and click on start to launch the timer.
- The second screen contains the timer, a circular progress bar for the timer which changes colors according to percentage of time left.
- Bar remains green until 50% of time is gone. It changes to oragne until 25% time is left and red when less than 25% of time remains.
- There is a Done state when timer completes and a Cancelled state when timer is cancelled while it's running.
- There are buttons in ToolBarItems for cancel, pause/play, restart and adding new timer.
- The project currently only supports one timer at a time.
- The watch OS app contains a widget with a timer and circular progress bar but it currently runs separately and not linked to the app timer.
